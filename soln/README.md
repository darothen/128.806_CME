Write-up for Computational Methods Exercise.

The notebook provided here is fully sulf-sufficient. I've also made an effort to create a nice, RestructuredText-based writeup, based on a snapshot of the notebook on January 30, 2017. That write-up can be built with Sphinx to make a nice PDF output. To build that version:

1. Run

``` shell
$ sphinx-build -b latex . _build/latex
```

2. Change to `_build/latex` and run **make**.
